WILL THE US PATENT OFFICE USE MACHINE LEARNING TO VIEW PRIOR ART 

I started devloping this tool in 2012 and surveyed patent attorneys and agents if a tool such as this would enable faster and more effective patent search. I also interviewed a friend at the Patent Office to find out if she thought this would become a possible tool for use by the patent office. My tool was sold effectively in 2019. While the business structure on making a larger sale might have been challenging, this did give me a chance to develop my Natural language processing skills. 

My learnings from demonstrating prior art search:
1) Most inventions are recomibation of several different inventions


Please find below some of the challenges associated with selling a tool such as this to the Patent Office. 

1) In the case of the Patent Office, the reality of a relatively powerful labor union complicates the human capital issue. The labor union should not, in principle, necessarily oppose a tool that would allow more effective search within the same number of hours. Indeed, to the extent that machine learning allows examiners to shift their efforts towards higher-skill activities like developing a clear record of their legal reasoning, it has the potential to improve job satisfaction. But fears regarding reduction in hours available to examine patents, or perhaps even a reduction in workforce, may motivate opposition.

2) The patent office does not believe that machine learning can be effective as humans when it comes to inventions that are sevearl different inventions only merged together.  We now have now a ignificant amount of empirical evidence indicating that invention occurs
through "recombination" of areas of prior art that were once distinct. If and when recombination of this once-conceptually distinct art becomes standard, training data consisting of prior art searches and office actions that predated the now-standardized recombination will be stale. These recombined technologies will require new training data. Additionally, training data should include not simply examiner search, but data from cases-either at the PTAB or in federal court-where additional, invalidating prior art was found.
